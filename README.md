## Downloading Fuel Throttle

Since Fuel Throttle uses Submodules and since GitHub Downloads don't support submodules, do not download Fuel Throttle using the Downloads link here.

Use the "Download" link on <http://fuel-throttle.com> instead.

## Cloning Fuel Throttle

Fuel Throttle uses submodules intensively. After you clone the repository you will need to init and update the submodules.

Here is the basic usage:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/fuel-throttle/fuel-throttle.git

The above command is the same as running:

    git clone git://github.com/fuel-throttle/fuel-throttle.git
    cd fuel-throttle/
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

You can also shorten the last two commands to one:

    git submodule update --init

## Fuel Framework

Fuel is a fast, lightweight PHP 5.3 framework. It's really a fantastic framework to develop with. If you want more information just go to http://fuelphp.com to find out more.
